# Interview Challenge: React Junior Developer

This is a coding challenge for prospective front-end developer applicants applying to NADUVI. If you're unfamiliar with React, Facebook has put together a helpful tutorial that provides a quick introduction to the basics: https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html

## Goal:

#### Build a simple React app that allows viewing and interacting with a grid of curated photos from Unsplash

- [ ] Clone this repository and create your own branch to work on.
- [ ] Use `create-react-app` to set up a basic single-page React application as shown here: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app. (NOTE: We will only focus on creating a single-page React application, so don't worry about the other sections on that page such as Next.js).
- [ ] Refer to the Unsplash API docs here to set up a developer account: https://unsplash.com/documentation.
- [ ] Display a grid of photos in your React app. Use the `GET /photos/curated` endpoint from the Unsplash API to get a set of curated images.
- [ ] The grid of photos should preserve the aspect ratio of the photos it's displaying, meaning it shouldn't crop the image in any way.
- [ ] The grid should be responsive, and should work in both portrait and landscape orientations on both mobile and desktop browsers.
- [ ] You're free to use existing open source React components or Javascript packages/libraries from npm to complete this task.
- [ ] Once you are ready, create a pull request with your code. 
### Evaluation:
- [ ] The React app should build without errors (typically using `npm run build`). If there are necessary steps required to get it to compile, those should be covered in README.md.
- [ ] No crashes or bugs.
- [ ] App should operate as a single-page application, without the need for a custom back-end.
- [ ] Code is easily understood and communicative (eg. comments, variable names, etc).
- [ ] GitHub commit history is consistent, easy to follow and understand.
